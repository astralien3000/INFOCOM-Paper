Robots are asked to accomplish more and more complex tasks.
They will need to collaborate with other robots or with the soon-to-be ubiquitous IoT infrastructure to fulfill some of these missions.
This paper is presenting a possible software and networking infrastructure for enabling the robots and IoT devices to take advantage of each other to achieve complex tasks.
An early implementation for a simplified use-case will also be described.
